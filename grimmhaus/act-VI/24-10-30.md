# The Dragon Tablet
- session 70
- 10/30/2024

## recap
- talked with bronte boys and lilah about city of night
    - city of night fractured in ideals?
- astrolabe krondis gave him a fake dragon tablet
    - left inviting us to collegium archive
    - arthas gave actual tablet to star watcher hojikiki
    - sadi good job and brought us in to speak about things
- at the collegium **in city of demaah/Dimans**

```text
-- retrieve wyrds from jukals managery --

Nimbus - "Nimbus is always full of energy and loves to play, especially with children. I bet he’s found his way to a playground or a park. If you hear the giggles of kids or see little sparks of lightning dancing through the air, he’s probably close by." 
    -> last seen in astrolabe

Bumble - "Bumble can’t resist causing a bit of trouble. I've heard from my trips to the the Collegium Arcanum that the students have been complaining about strange pranks and missing items. I’d wager Bumble is behind it, having the time of his life!"
    -> with cletus

Tiny - "Tiny has a strange fondness for cleaning up decay, which means he’s likely wandered into some dark, forgotten corner of the city. Look in places where death lingers—graveyards, abandoned buildings—he’ll be quietly trying to make things right."
    -> could be in the house of white (graveyard)

Jeremy - "Jeremy could literally be anyone by now—he’s a master of blending in. But one thing hasn’t changed: he’s always been drawn to a good story. If you’re looking for him, try places where tales are told and secrets are shared."
    -> use elliots nonstop story telling to lure jeremy?

Bluebell - "Bluebell’s love for music is well-known, and there’s no doubt she’s found herself lost in the melodies of the city. She’s probably near a place where the arts thrive, but remember, she can’t be far from water. Keep your ears open and follow the music—you might just find her."
    -> suspect: the mystro stole bluebell from fountain

returned:
- basal and blossom: found with sugar cookies

collected: 
- (arthas) elliot: found with stories in sylvan  

```

## notes
- young cartographer how did you find this
    - not seen in generations, thoussands of years
    - random guy hadned it to us? after we made deal with forest nymphs? hunting down a wagon
    - dr issac randall
        - you met the trubador? he is one of t eh ost prolific wonderers of us all..
        - oh i understand now, looks at us reverently
        - it is good you brought this to us, what did you want to know?
    - do you all know what a dragon is?
        - in the time before aeterno was rules by 9 dragon lrods and a dragon tyrant
        - they weilded aether of immese power sought to conquer all worlds
        - this tablet is one of the 9 dragon songs
        - each uses a different song
    - what do you know of aether
        - seeking an aetheric shard to teleport trubadoors mansion
        - pulls out from his robe a small necklace with cloudy old crystal
        - puts it on the table, grabs a lense and puts it over
            - prismatic colors swirl around the room
            - this si the true aether
            - unfortunately it has been split
            - the diferent colors represent a color and eachdragon song is an element
                - this one is EST the aether of being/matter
        - only one legend left from that time
        - when all songs are sung together aether shall be remade
            - instead of a myraid of elements that react against eachoter
            - it will be a force of pure reality
    - reunite the aether and we can return home
    - looks slowly around the table, whic one of you comes from human parents
        - norman and micha and kith kind of raises his hand
        - humans have become natural, not always liek that, this was never our home
        - rolls up his sleeve and shows numbers
        - before i was called teh star watcehr i had another name
        - john morgan
        - i traveled here on a beam of light 3000 years ago
        - us and our kind are not of this world
        - our home was destroyed and we can never go back
            - when we say go back... not sure what that means
    - all tablets lost eons ago, time of the dragon war not much known celestials vs dragons
        - norman read celestial text about a boat in a desert turned into a gambling hall, perhaps a remnant of the war
        - "sail to the light, find teh place you need to be"
    - why does the aether need to be purified to get home
        - we dont have the songs we cant fly on light
        - if we can reunite the aether we could
            - looks wild -remake reality itself
            - shaza el wanted to rewrite reality? reset time to a past time to change present eventes as they are
    - that sounds like a job fo rthe gods
        - they only call themselves the gods because there is no one to counter them
        - they were not the first and they will not be the last
        - no one knows the first gods
        - befor ehte dragon war everything is so unknown
        - alsmost as if all records were destoryed somehow
            - someone have a reason to?
            - cartographers.. what is the only purpose in destorying knowledge
            - hide the truth, who is trying to hide
            - only reson we destroy knowledge is to destoy the truth
    - hoshukiki looks at arthas, you have done well cartographer
        - you shall be known as a master cartographer
        - we will do anything to assist
    - call upon the reveerent mother and she sends out the aether est to rebind the bones and blood
        - if no longer split, you could acess ast and non and lumen an dhydor and all together
        - no longer repairing but remaking
        - something like "spell slots" never worry about a slot every again for anything
    - intonations not an actual song, like sheet music
    - norman wants to help the reverend mother out of her perdicament
        - communications have been unheard or diverted
        - prerecorded response
        - thats because the gods never care about teh machanics of men, only our devotion
    - the reverend mother tells me all things are in her plan
    - she hurts us because she loves us
        - that is the athougth of the abused
        - free will is always ours to take, you subjugate yourself to the gods
        - i have seen beyond this world adn their parlor tricks
        - open your ears to hear more, what is that plan?
            - not for us to know, then why are you doing it
            - my actions are guided, you give up your agency and critical thinking
            - i am not ashamed of a life of dedicated service
            - did you not hear of the priest in port artoirois that killed hundreds because he could? i hear he is still on the run
                - lies spread by the curch
                - effective lies
    - picks up his aether shard, ugh you have so much to learn
        - i cannot keep this here anymore, gives it back to arthas
        - put it in your new library (hope?)
    - you did just give a copy to some random person?
        - just because i talk to him doesnt mean i like him
        - krondis is a crochety old asshole, he spends more time with his papers than humans
