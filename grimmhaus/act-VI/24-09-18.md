```text
-- retrieve wyrds from jukals managery --

Nimbus - "Nimbus is always full of energy and loves to play, especially with children. I bet he’s found his way to a playground or a park. If you hear the giggles of kids or see little sparks of lightning dancing through the air, he’s probably close by." 

Bumble - "Bumble can’t resist causing a bit of trouble. I've heard from my trips to the the Collegium Arcanum that the students have been complaining about strange pranks and missing items. I’d wager Bumble is behind it, having the time of his life!"

Tiny - "Tiny has a strange fondness for cleaning up decay, which means he’s likely wandered into some dark, forgotten corner of the city. Look in places where death lingers—graveyards, abandoned buildings—he’ll be quietly trying to make things right."
    -> could be in the house of white (graveyard)

Jeremy - "Jeremy could literally be anyone by now—he’s a master of blending in. But one thing hasn’t changed: he’s always been drawn to a good story. If you’re looking for him, try places where tales are told and secrets are shared."
    -> use elliots nonstop story telling to lure jeremy?

Bluebell - "Bluebell’s love for music is well-known, and there’s no doubt she’s found herself lost in the melodies of the city. She’s probably near a place where the arts thrive, but remember, she can’t be far from water. Keep your ears open and follow the music—you might just find her."
    -> suspect: the mystro stole bluebell from fountain

returned:
- basal and blossom: found with sugar cookies

collected: 
- (arthas) elliot: found with stories in sylvan  

```
