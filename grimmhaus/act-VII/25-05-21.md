```text
i am born where shadow meets the dawn
a silent pact once tightly drawn
two halves that danced the endless sky
until one whispered a bitter lie
the veiled light betrayed the night 
fractured bonds unmade the flight
a prism's age now holds the one
whos shattered world no longer runs
though stars may fall and ages turn
from fractured ashes fires burn
what breaks the whole yet binds it too
a force unseen yet ever true
```
